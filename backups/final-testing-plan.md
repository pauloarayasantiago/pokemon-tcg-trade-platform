3. Test each feature according to the checklist
4. Document any issues encountered

If any features don't work as expected:
- Check the console for errors

## Recovery Process

If critical functionality is broken:
1. Restore the necessary files from the backups created in Phase 4
2. Update import paths to match the new structure
3. Retest the affected functionality

## Completion Criteria

The Final Testing phase will be considered complete when:
