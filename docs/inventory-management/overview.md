## Key Components

<key_components>
### 1. Inventory Database

The core of the inventory system is the `inventory` table in our Supabase PostgreSQL database. This table tracks all cards that users have made available for trading or selling.

Key relationships:
- Each inventory item belongs to a user
- Each inventory item references a specific card and variation
- Inventory items can be linked to specific stores for delivery

### 2. Inventory Management UI

The user interface for inventory management includes:
- Dashboard for viewing and managing listed cards
- Add/Edit forms for individual card listings
- Bulk import tools for adding multiple cards
- Analytics for tracking inventory performance

### 3. API Services

Backend services that power the inventory system:
- CRUD operations for inventory items
- Search functionality for finding cards
- Pricing recommendations based on market data
- Inventory analytics and reporting

### 4. Integration Points

The inventory system integrates with:
- User Trading Flow for connecting buyers and sellers
- Collection Management for moving cards between collection and inventory
- Delivery System for handling physical card transfers
- WhatsApp for communication about inventory items
