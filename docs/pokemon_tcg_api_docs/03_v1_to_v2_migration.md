Version 2 of this API has quite a few differences:

## Usage
- Support for more advanced queries with more operators
- New q parameter for performing queries. Individual fields are no longer used as query string parameters. Look at the /cards endpoint documentation for more details.
- API Keys now accepted to get access to better rate limits (and the potential to be changed on a per user basis). Provide API keys via the X-Api-Key header. Signup for an API Key at https://dev.pokemontcg.io. If you encounter issues, feel free to contact me at andrew@pokemontcg.io or on Discord.

## Card JSON Response Changes
- subtype is now subtypes (array of strings)
- ability is now abilities to support cards with multiple abilities
- nationalPokedexNumber is now nationalPokedexNumbers to support cards that feature more than one pokemon on them (like TAG TEAM)
- imageUrl and imageUrlHiRes have been replaced by an images section which currently has small and large fields on it. This could potentially hold other art like unlimited versions, etc.
- legalities has been added to each card. Every card will now specify what format it is legal or banned in. If the legality does not exist on a given card, that means it is simply not a legal card for that format. {"standard": "Banned", "expanded": "Legal", "unlimited": "Legal"}
- set info is now embedded in a card, instead of having a setCode and a set (name) field.
- Pagination info is now included in the body of response versus the headers. You can access the page, pageSize, count and totalCount from here.
- ALL card/set response bodies will be inside a data element in the response body, versus sets or cards. It will now always be data (same with other endpoints like /subtypes).
- text is now rules. In a similar manner to text, rules contains any rule information on a given card.
- tcgplayer contains pricing information from TCGPlayer, and the URL to the page to purchase the card.
- legalities is a new field specifying the legality of a card in Standard, Expanded, Or legal. If a legality does not exist on a given card, that means it is simply not a legal card for that format (different from banned.) If Legal or Banned, it will be specified.
- flavorText contains the flavor text for a card.
- evolvesTo is an array of strings for which pokemon the card evolves to

## Set JSON Response Changes
- legalities has replaced all legality info, similar to the card response. standardLegal and expandedLegal fields have been removed.
- printedTotal is the total shown on a card. This replaces totalCards.
- total is the printed total PLUS the additional secret rares or any other card actually part of this set
- images is a new field that contains a symbol and logo. This replaces the symbolUrl and logoUrl fields.

## General Updates

ALL endpoints that return data all have their data in a data field, versus having a cards or sets or subtypes field.

## Data Changes

BREAKING - Aquapolis and Skyridge H1-H32 cards have new IDs. The new IDs follow the expected pattern of {set id}-{card number}. Examples include ecard2-H1, ecard3-H32, etc.

Full rebuild - Every single set has been rebuilt with tons of updates ranging from typos, to missing attacks, to simply incorrect data.
